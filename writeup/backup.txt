Phase 3 Write-up
Kurt Andres, Leanne Miller, Andrew Thompson, and Conner Vick

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
The project is divided into four packages: gui, model, render, and storage. Each package is responsible for different aspects of the application. Each package will be explained in detail below. To start the project run Driver.java in the gui package.
G.U.I.
The gui package stores the .fxml, .css, and controller .java files for the various windows used. It also stores Driver.java, which has the main method is a JavaFX Application.
Model

Render

Storage
The desktop version maintains its own database (timeline.db) while the user is adding/editing timelines, events etc. This is done in DBHelper.java. On load the program prompts the user for a name and password and phpDBHelper.java makes php calls and gets the user’s data from the online database and loads it into the timeline.db. phpPushHelper.java updates the online database with all of the new data when the user hits save.
